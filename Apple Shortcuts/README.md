# The Apple Shortcuts®

We have a **single** file available for sharing since **automation** cannot be shared directly from the [Apple Shortcuts®](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334) app. This limitation requires you to manually automate which app triggers the [System](JavaScript/System.js) script.

This also means you can **copy-paste** the same automation for any app you'd like, and it will give you some **nice XP**!
