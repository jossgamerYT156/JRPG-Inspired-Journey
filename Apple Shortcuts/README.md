# Apple ShortcutsÂ®

We have a **single** file available for sharing, since **automation** cannot be shared directly from the [Apple ShortcutsÂ®](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334) app. This limitation means youâ€™ll need to **manually** set up which app triggers the [System](JavaScript/System.js) script.

That said, you can **copy-paste** the same automation for any app you like â€” and itâ€™ll give you some **nice XP** every time you open it!
