## 📱 A Rewarding Experience: Earn XP Every Time You Open an App

### Requirements:
- [Scriptable](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188) – Available on the App Store.
- Apple Shortcuts – Pre-installed on every iPhone running iOS 18.x.
- A tad bit of knowledge on how to follow instructions – 🧠 *Required for the user!*

## 🎮 What Does It Do?

- Gives you XP each time you open an app like [Journal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/journal/id6447391597) by Apple.
- Lets you level up by consistently opening an app — and each level requires more logins than the last, making it a lil’ more challenging as you go. :3
- Rewards you with Skill Points, which you can spend on unlockable skills (see the provided Shortcut in the Apple Shortcuts directory!).
